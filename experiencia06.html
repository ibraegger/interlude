            <p>Now we will count to twelve<br>and we will all keep still.</p>

            <p>This one time upon the earth,<br>let’s not speak any language,<br>let’s stop for one second,<br>and not move our arms so much.</p>

            <p>It would be a delicious moment,<br>without hurry, without locomotives,<br>all of us would be together<br>in a sudden uneasiness.</p>

            <p>The fishermen in the cold sea<br>would do no harm to the whales<br>and the peasant gathering salt<br>would look at his torn hands.</p>

            <p>Those who prepare green wars,<br>wars of gas, wars of fire,<br>victories without survivors,<br>would put on clean clothing<br>and would walk alongside their brothers<br>in the shade, without doing a thing.</p>

            <p>What I want shouldn’t be confused<br>with final inactivity:<br>life alone is what matters,<br>I want nothing to do with death.</p>

            <p>If we weren’t unanimous<br>about keeping our lives so much in motion,</p>

            <p>if we could do nothing for once,<br>perhaps a great silence would<br>interrupt this sadness,<br>this never understanding ourselves<br>and threatening ourselves with death,<br>perhaps the earth is teaching us<br>when everything seems to be dead<br>and then everything is alive.</p>

            <p>Now I will count to twelve<br>and you keep quiet and I’ll go.</p>
